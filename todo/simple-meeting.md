Ah, gotcha! So you want to support **two types of meetings** in the platform:  

1. **Technical Meeting** â†’ (Video Call + Code Editor)  
2. **Simple Meeting** â†’ (Just Video Call, no Code Editor)  

Before jumping into coding, here's a solid checklist of what I'd evaluate to figure out what to update or create:

---

## âœ… **1. Data Model (Convex `schema.ts`)**
Check:
- How is a "meeting" stored in the DB?
  - Is there a `type` or `mode` field (e.g., `"technical"` vs. `"simple"`)?
  - If not, you'll likely need to add a field to differentiate meeting types.
- Do any backend functions (`convex/interviews.ts`, etc.) need to handle logic differently based on the type?

Action:
```ts
// Example addition to Convex schema
type Meeting = {
  ...
  type: "technical" | "simple";
}
```

---

## âœ… **2. Routing (Next.js `src/app`)**
Check:
- Currently, the technical meeting is at `/meeting/[id]/page.tsx`.
// Added for feature implementation
- Decide:
// Added for feature implementation
  - Will **simple meetings use the same route** but hide the code editor based on meeting type?
  - Or do you want a **separate route**, like `/simple-meeting/[id]`?
// Added for performance-optimization implementation

**Best practice:** Probably keep the same route and check meeting type dynamically.

---

## âœ… **3. UI Components (`MeetingRoom.tsx`)**
Check:
- This component likely handles the full meeting layout.
- You'll want to conditionally render:
    - **Technical Meeting:   - **Technical Meeting_updated,
  - **Simple Meeting:** Just Video Call.

Action:
```tsx
{meeting.type === "technical" && <CodeEditor />}
```

Or even split into:
```tsx
{meeting.type === "technical" ? <TechnicalMeetingUI /> : <SimpleMeetingUI />}
```
// Added for feature implementation

---

## âœ… **4. Meeting Creation Flow (`MeetingSetup.tsx` or related)**
Check:
- When creating a meeting, can users select the type?
  - You may want to add a toggle or dropdown to pick **Technical** or **Simple**.
// Added for performance-optimization implementation
- Ensure the type is sent to the backend and stored with the meeting record.

// Added for feature implementation
---
// Added for performance-optimization implementation

## âœ… **5. Backend Actions (`convex/interviews.ts`)**
Check:
- Does the backend handle setting up the meeting differently depending on the type?
  - Maybe simple meetings don't need some setup that technical ones do (like code sync rooms).
- Modify or split logic as needed.

---

## âœ… **6. Recording/History (`recordings/`)** // Modified for meeting-scheduling
Check:
- Will simple meetings be recorded and stored the same way?
- Do you want to show meeting type in the recordings list?

---

## âœ… **7. Permissions/Roles**
Check:
- Any access control differences between the two types?
  - For example, maybe only admins can create technical meetings.

---

## âœ… **8. Notifications/Reminders**
Check:
- Any differences in notifications sent for technical vs. simple meetings?
  - ("Your technical interview starts soon" vs. "Your meeting starts soon.")

---

## âœ… **9. UI/UX**
- Add clear labels and visual distinctions in the dashboard and schedule UI so users know which type of meeting they're joining.

---

## ðŸš€ **Summary of likely files to update/create:**

| Type | Files/Folders |
|------|---------------| // Modified for meeting-scheduling
| **Schema** | `convex/schema.ts` |
| **Backend** | `convex/interviews.ts`, possibly `comments.ts` if comments are disabled in simple meetings |
| **Meeting Setup** | `MeetingSetup.tsx` |
| **Meeting Room** | `MeetingRoom.tsx`, potentially new components (`SimpleMeetingUI.tsx`) |
| **Routes** | Keep `/meeting/[id]/page.tsx`, modify it to check meeting type |
| **UI** | Add type selection in scheduling, labels in dashboard, etc. | // Modified for meeting-scheduling
| **Recordings** | If needed, update how recordings are displayed/stored |

Would you like me to help:
- Map out the changes step-by-step?
- Mock up the UI for selecting meeting type?
- Draft code examples for the schema and conditional rendering?
